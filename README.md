# Weather-trends-campinas

The project below shows a comparison between the city of Campinas (Brazil) and global average temperatures. For this project some tools were used: Udacity's SQL Workspace, 
Excel, Python and Jupyter notebooks.

# Dataset

It is possible to analyze two datasets for this project: Global Average Temperature and Campinas Average Temperature. The datasets are in csv format, have more than 180 rows 
and were downloaded through Udacity's website. 

## Packages

The project requires installation of the following packages: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and the magic function `%Matplotlib inline`.

## Structure

The project has a brief introduction, has an analysis of the datasets and a plot section to analyze trends. By the end, a conclusion about the analysis is made.

## Conclusion

Analysing the line graph, it is possible to observe that the local and global average temperature increased about 2Â°C in almost 100 years.

It is possible to verify a rapid increase in temperature after 1975, possibly due to the increased emission of harmful gases to the atmosphere.

The behaviour of the curves are similar (but not equal) and shows that the temperatures follow the same trend.

The moving average temperature of Campinas has some fluctuations, which could have occurred for many reasons like imprecise meassurement or lack of data in some season 
of the year, for example. To reach a precise conclusion it is necessary further analisys in how and when the data was extracted and measured.
